This site is building now.
The contents will be updated until 24th May 2021.

I'm a Ph.D. student majoring in computer vision in the dept. of Physics and Applied Physics at Waseda University, working on virtual try-on and model compresssion for deep generative models;
now I focus on the vision and language research domain which utilizes embodiment.
If you want to see more my details, please see the `Publication`, `Talks`, `Teaching` and `CV` tabs.
